Description: Contains the framework of the estimation, sampling, and hypotheses testing for two special distributions (Exponentiated Exponential-Pareto and Exponentiated Inverse Gamma-Pareto) within the family of Generalized Exponentiated Composite distributions. The detailed explanation and the applications of these two distributions were introduced in Bowen Liu, Malwane M.A. Ananda (2022) <doi:10.1080/03610926.2022.2050399>, Bowen Liu, Malwane M.A. Ananda (2022) <doi:10.3390/math10111895>, and Bowen Liu, Malwane M.A. Ananda (2022) <doi:10.3390/app13010645>.
